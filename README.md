The project includes a comprehensive analysis of the time series covering the price of Bitcoin from January 1, 2015, to January 14, 2024, followed by the preparation of a predictive model that forecasts the price of Bitcoin three days ahead. The project encompasses:

1. Data analysis, feature creation, and preparation of data for training. The work was conducted in Jupyter notebooks, which are located in the "notebooks" folder.
2. Compilation of data created in point 1 into the "data" folder. Due to the size of the data, Cloud storage services such as AWS S3 were not used.
3. Conducting experiments in MLflow that include selecting optimal hyperparameters and training the XGboost model. The scripts with the source code written in Python are in the "scripts" folder.
